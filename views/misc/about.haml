		My first language is

		, after that it comes Spanish, and then English. I also studied German in high school, and some Japanese a couple of years ago.

		In my job, and also as a hobby, I develop web applications, and I make it fun by using Ruby on Rails. I have more than 7 years of experience developing web applications with PHP and ASP. I really enjoy programming, and I always think "hey, that's a nice thought, let's blog it", but I rarely do.
